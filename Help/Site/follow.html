		<h1>Followed words</h1>
			
		<p>
			A <dfn>followed word</dfn> is a <em>shorter</em> word entry that can be transformed into another, <em>longer</em> entry by adding letters to its end.
		</p>			
		<p>
			Word entries that are <em>not</em> followed score one point, and add time bonuses equal to their length minus three. The length of each time bonus is determined by the <a href="setup.html#pace">Pace slider</a> on the Setup dialog.
		</p>			
		<p>
			In this example, the word <em>fine</em> has been entered:
		</p>
			
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<td>Entry</td>
					<td>Points</td>
					<td>Time bonuses</td>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>fine</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>1</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
			
		<p>
			If <em>finest</em> is entered next, <em>fine</em> becomes a followed word, since it can be changed to <em>finest</em> by adding <em>st</em>. The first entry is invalidated, and one point is awarded for the second, along with three time bonuses:
		</p>
			
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<td>Entry</td>
					<td>Points</td>
					<td>Time bonuses</td>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>fine</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>finest</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>3</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
			
		<p>
			If <em>fines</em> is entered, it is immediately invalidated, and no point is scored. Though it follows <em>fine</em>, it is itself already followed by <em>finest</em>:
		</p>
			
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<td>Entry</td>
					<td>Points</td>
					<td>Time bonuses</td>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>fine</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>finest</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>3</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>fines</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
						
		<p>
			For an entry to be followed, it must be possible to transform it to another entry by <em>adding</em> letters; simply sharing a root is not enough. Thus, entering <em>finer</em> scores a point without invalidating anything, though it would have invalidated <em>fine</em> if that word had not already been followed:
		</p>
			
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<td>Entry</td>
					<td>Points</td>
					<td>Time bonuses</td>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>fine</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>finest</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>3</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>fines</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>finer</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>2</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
			
		<p>
			A word is followed only when letters are added to its <em>end</em>, so entering <em>refiner</em> scores a point without invalidating <em>finer</em>:
		</p>
			
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<td>Entry</td>
					<td>Points</td>
					<td>Time bonuses</td>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>fine</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>finest</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>3</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>fines</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>finer</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>refiner</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>4</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
			
		<p>
			Finally, only <em>player</em>-entered words cause other words to be followed. If <em>finery</em> is spelled within the grid, and if the player fails to find it, <em>finer</em> will remain valid, even though Ogle finds and scores <em>finery</em> itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			These rules becomes intuitive with practice. Followed words are ignored so you don't have to enter the same string repeatedly when longer words (especially plurals) are encountered. When you find a group of related words, just enter the longest one, and you'll get as many points and as much bonus time as is possible.

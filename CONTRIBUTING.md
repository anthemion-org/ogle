# Contributing to Ogle

Hello, and thanks for checking out this project!

I am no longer developing this version of Ogle. Some day I would like to rewrite the app with WPF; that is the only sensible way to solve the 'blurry UI' problem observed on modern displays. I also plan to add a bunch of statistics to the Score dialog: number of points scored by word length, percentage found by length, et cetera. I will replace the word lists as well.

There probably isn't much reason for you to contribute to this version, either. The project is covered by a [permissive license](https://github.com/anthemion-org/ogle/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), however, so you are welcome to do as you like!
